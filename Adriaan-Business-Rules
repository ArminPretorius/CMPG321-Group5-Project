1. Data Collection and Monitoring: Implement a Traffic Management Database System to collect real-time data from various sources 
such as IoT devices, Google Earth, traffic management authorities, NWU campus stakeholders, and the NWU community.

2. Data Integration: Integrate data from different sources into a centralized database system to create 
a comprehensive view of traffic patterns and congestion levels.

3. Data Analysis: Apply advanced analytics techniques to the collected data to identify traffic 
trends, predict congestion, and optimize traffic flow.

4. Data Visualization: Develop visualizations and dashboards to present traffic data and routes in a 
user-friendly and easily understandable manner.

5. Real-time Data Updates: The Traffic Management Database System should be updated in real-time to ensure the 
availability  of the most current information.

6. Data Privacy and Security: The Traffic Management Database System should adhere to strict data privacy 
and security  measures to protect the personal information of individuals. Access to sensitive data should 
be restricted to authorized personnel only.

7. Optimization of Commuting Routes: The Traffic Management Database System should provide algorithms 
and tools to optimize commuting routes based on factors such as distance, safety, and environmental impact. 
This will help enhance urban mobility and sustainability by promoting efficient and eco-friendly modes of 
transportation.

8. Traffic Prediction: The system should use historical data and predictive analytics to forecast 
traffic patterns and predict future congestion. This information can be used to optimize traffic 
flow and plan alternative routes.

9. Standards and Guidelines: The system should adhere to established standards and guidelines for data 
collection, storage, and analysis. These standards should be legible, practical, future-proof, and 
promote innovation in the field of traffic management.

10. Generate Reports: Provide users with reports on traffic flow analysis, congestion patterns, incident 
summaries, and user feedback.
