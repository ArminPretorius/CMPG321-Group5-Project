# Business Rules (Armin)

1. **Traffic Flow Optimization:**\
   Utilize dynamic traffic signal control to adapt signal timings at intersections in response to real-time traffic flow,
   giving precedence to heavy-traffic routes during peak hours for congestion reduction, and leveraging historical traffic data for
   proactive management of bottlenecks.

2. **Pedestrian Safety Enhancement:**\
   Enhance pedestrian safety by maintaining clear signage and markings at crosswalks, introducing intelligent pedestrian signals that
   adapt crossing durations according to pedestrian volumes, and deploying extra safety measures such as speed bumps in areas with
   high pedestrian activity.

3. **Bicycle Lane Management:**\
   Utilize sensors or cameras to track bicycle lane usage and capacity, offering live updates on lane availability to cyclists
   via a dedicated app, while also synchronizing traffic and bike lane signals to guarantee secure crossing opportunities.

4. **Emergency Vehicle Priority:**\
   Facilitate emergency vehicle passage by enabling traffic signals to grant them precedence through route clearance, coupled with
   a communication system that shares the emergency vehicle's location and path with nearby vehicles to enhance overall traffic flow.

5. **Parking Management:**\
   Deploy sensors for parking spot detection, offering drivers real-time availability updates, while also introducing dynamic
   parking pricing models that respond to demand fluctuations to promote optimal utilization of parking spaces.

6. **Public Transportation Integration:**\
   Create a synchronized system aligning public transportation schedules with traffic signals to facilitate seamless transit, coupled with real-time updates
   on bus or shuttle positions to incentivize their utilization and alleviate private vehicle congestion.

7. **Event Traffic Management:**\
   Track event calendars to predict traffic surges during special occasions and adapt traffic management strategies accordingly to accommodate
   heightened traffic volumes.

8. **Environmental Considerations:**\
   Integrate weather data into traffic management choices to dynamically adjust to evolving conditions, optimizing traffic signals
   and speed limits in response to weather-related variables.

9. **User Feedback Incorporation:**\
   Enable users to submit traffic condition feedback via a dedicated app or platform, utilizing this input to pinpoint problematic areas and iteratively
   enhance the traffic management system.

10. **Data Privacy and Security:**\
   Establish comprehensive security protocols to safeguard user data and uphold privacy, while also ensuring adherence to pertinent data protection regulations when
   gathering and leveraging user information.

11. **Sustainability Initiatives:**\
   Foster environmentally conscious transportation alternatives such as electric vehicle charging stations, while motivating carpooling through incentive
   programs and adaptable carpool lanes.

12. **Real-time Traffic Updates:**\
   Create a mobile app or website offering users live traffic updates, harnessing data from traffic cameras and sensors to deliver real-time road condition
   information to commuters.
